/**
 * The `criteria` package contains classes and interfaces that define the
 * criteria
 * for scoring points in the Point Salad game. Each criterion specifies a
 * condition
 * that must be met to earn points. The criteria can be combined to form complex
 * scoring rules.
 * 
 * This package includes the following components:
 * 
 * - {@link pointcards.game.pointsalad.criteria.ICriteria}: An interface that
 * defines
 * the methods for calculating points based on specific criteria.
 * - {@link pointcards.game.pointsalad.criteria.Criterias}: A class that
 * represents
 * a collection of criteria, allowing multiple criteria to be combined.
 * - {@link pointcards.game.pointsalad.criteria.CriteriaType}: An enumeration
 * that
 * defines the different types of criteria available in the game.
 * 
 * The criteria package is essential for defining the scoring rules and logic
 * in the Point Salad game, enabling flexible and customizable point
 * calculations.
